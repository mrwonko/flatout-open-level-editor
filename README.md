# FlatOut Open Level Editor

Here's a cool idea: what if we could build our own levels for FlatOut 2?

In recent years, [Blender](https://blender.org) has evolved into a powerful customizable platform.
I think it would make a suitable base for a level editor.

As I explore that possibility, I will use this repository to collect my research, experiments and results.

Please don't expect to much. I should have the necessary programming skills, but sticking to large hobby projects has never been a strength of mine, especially not since I started working. I will try to document my work well enough for somebody else to take over some day.
